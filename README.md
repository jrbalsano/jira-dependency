# JIRA Dependency Chart Generator

Use the JIRA API to draw dependency charts in a standalone app

## Development

Clone the repo and run `npm install`. Once finished, run `npm start`. This app has hot loading so most of the time if your
changes aren't too big the app should refresh itself itself while you develop.
